The solution is to use functional updates within the `useState` call and ensure that any dependencies for the `useCallback` are correctly listed and updated if any indirect change occurs. This allows for the callback function to use the latest state every time it's called:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1); // Functional update
  }, []); // Empty dependency array

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

By using a functional update (`prevCount => prevCount + 1`), we guarantee that the `incrementCount` function always uses the most up-to-date value of `count`, regardless of external changes. The empty dependency array for `useCallback` now makes sense, since the function's logic does not depend on any state variable directly. If there are other dependencies that needs to be considered for useCallback, the corresponding variables must also be listed in the dependency array.
